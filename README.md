# Professor Ratings Bias Analysis 

This project was developed as part of my *Principles of Data Science* course at NYU, where I explored potential biases and trends in student evaluations of professors. The goal was to examine how factors such as gender, teaching modality (in-person vs online), and department might influence professor ratings.

## 🔍 Project Questions
- Are there measurable gender biases in how students rate professors?
- Do teaching modalities (e.g. remote vs in-person) correlate with higher or lower ratings?
- What features best predict a professor's average score?

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn (for basic modeling)  

## 📈 Key Insights
- Statistically significant gender disparities were observed across certain departments.
- Professors teaching online tended to receive lower average ratings in specific subject areas.
- Sentiment scores and course level (intro vs advanced) also had predictive value.

## 📁 Files
- `notebooks/analysis.ipynb` — Main analysis notebook
- `visuals/` — Contains charts/graphs used in the final report
- `data/` — Sample (anonymized) data

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Run deeper sentiment analysis on qualitative reviews.
- Compare rating distributions over time (e.g., pre- vs. post-pandemic).
